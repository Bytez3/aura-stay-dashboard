## 🔧 **DETAILED COMPONENT AUDIT**

### **1. HEADER COMPONENT ✅**
**Status:** CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Proper `'use client'` directive
- ✅ Next.js `Link` components (not React Router)
- ✅ `usePathname()` for active states (not useLocation)
- ✅ Named export: `export function Header()`
- ✅ Proper client-side window usage with guards

**Navigation Structure:**
```
✅ Home, Project (dropdown), Finance (dropdown), Community
✅ Project dropdown: Roadmap, Transparency, Volcano House  
✅ Finance dropdown: Treasury Monitor, Trading Hub, 2% Burn System, Wallet Hub
✅ Two-button system: "Buy with Fiat" + "Buy $AURA"
✅ Custom wallet connection (Phantom/Solflare)
```

### **2. ROUTING SYSTEM ✅**
**Status:** FULLY MIGRATED TO NEXT.JS APP ROUTER

**✅ All React Router patterns removed:**
- ❌ No `react-router-dom` imports found in active code
- ❌ No `useLocation`, `useNavigate`, `useParams` in active code
- ❌ No `<Router>`, `<Routes>`, `<Route>` components

**✅ Next.js App Router implemented:**
- ✅ All pages in `src/app/` directory structure
- ✅ `page.tsx` files for all routes
- ✅ `layout.tsx` for global layout
- ✅ Dynamic routes properly structured

### **3. HYDRATION ISSUES ✅**
**Status:** ALL RESOLVED

**Previously fixed issues:**
- ✅ `Math.random()` moved to client-side useEffect 
- ✅ `Date.now()` with mounted state guards
- ✅ `typeof window` checks replaced with useEffect
- ✅ All components using hooks have `'use client'`

**Components verified:**
- ✅ CommunityGrowthMetrics: Client-side randomization
- ✅ LiveBurnMetrics: Mounted state guards  
- ✅ FiatPurchase: Proper window usage
- ✅ EnhancedAuraStats: Client-side data generation

### **4. CLIENT/SERVER BOUNDARIES ✅**
**Status:** PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED

**✅ Client Components (with 'use client'):**
- All interactive components with hooks
- Components using browser APIs
- Components with event handlers

**✅ Server Components (no directive):**
- Static UI components
- Layout components 
- Pure presentation components
